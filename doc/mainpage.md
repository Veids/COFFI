COFFI is a header-only C++ library intended for reading and generating files in Common Object File Format (COFF).
It is used as a standalone library - it is not dependant on any other product or project.
Adhering to ISO C++ (C++14 and newer), it compiles on a wide variety of architectures and compilers.

As the COFF binary format standard is extended or violated in many implementations,
this library only supports a very small subset of the COFF implementations, including:

- Windows portable executable (PE) format
- Texas Instruments COFF
- CEVA, Inc COFF

The full library documentation can be found in *[COFFI - Tutorial and User Manual](https://coffi.readthedocs.io/)*.
